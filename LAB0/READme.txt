I have installed Ubuntu 20.04 using VirtualBox on my home PC.

I am currently installing it on my laptop as well, I will finish setting everything up in the coming days. If you are seeing this, I forgot to update the READme file.

I have installed git on my virtual machine as well. I used Git to upload this text file. I am ready to use Git and GitHub.
